# UFO Sightings Webpage

## Analysis Overview
Dana's goal is to build a website for UFO enthusiasts to have accessible data regarding UFO sightings. The site consists of a table using data stored in a JavaScript array. Filters were also created to make the table fully dynamic and placed in an HTML file for easy viewing in a webpage customized using Bootstrap. Theu ser can enter search criteria to filter the table according to the information they would like displayed.

## Project Results
Five filters have been integrated in the websited for the user to search for relevant data. The filters are Date, City, State, Country, and Shape. A website user can browse through the entire table or filter according to their interes. For example, to display sightings in el cajon, CA, USA, enter those items in the filter boxes to see the results.

To see all sightings of disk-shaped objects, enter "disk" in the shape filter to see those results.

## Summary
The website is a great starting point for UFO enthusiasts, however, improvements can be made. A drawback of the current design is that the data is static, the site would benefit from real-time data from an API call. The site can also be improved by adding a "reset filters" button to the Filter Search, and by allowing the user to sign up for notifications of sightings in their area.
